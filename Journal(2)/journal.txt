Week 1
    This week I used AI to help me while brainstorming ideas for the group semester project.
I used Chatgpt for ideas under the information retrieval and analysis category. One of my group members had 
already brought up the idea of imrpoving spotify databases. Taking this into consideration, I used 
Chatgpt to come up with the idea of diversity vs. popularity. Chatgpt helped point out how Spotify tends to recommend
artists and genres that listeners are already familiar with, instead of exposing them to other artists worldwide. Using AI
made it easier to narrow down our idea. https://chatgpt.com/share/68cf2bb0-a828-8002-951d-a7108e93dcbb 
    I also used Chatgpt to explain one concept that I needed to review before doing the exercises. I needed a quick example
how to use (s[start:end]). Sometimes its easier to visualize example code instead of having someone explain it conceptually.

Week 2
    This week, I didn't use AI as much as I thought I would need to. 
I only used it to re-jog my memory for some of the week 2 exercises. There were some concepts that I needed a refresfer on.
I mostly needed some assistance on the formatting of for loops, how to keep track of the current position in a list, and so on.
I think going forward, I need to be more specific when giving chatgpt prompts. I don't like how it automatically would write out
some code examples because I wanted to see how much I could remember on my own. However, I think it did do a good job at explaining 
the concepts because I was able to successfully complete the exercises. https://chatgpt.com/share/68d99567-b6bc-8002-b422-800d6d4bd7d0
