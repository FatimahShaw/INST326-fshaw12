Week 1
    This week I used AI to help me while brainstorming ideas for the group semester project.
I used Chatgpt for ideas under the information retrieval and analysis category. One of my group members had 
already brought up the idea of imrpoving spotify databases. Taking this into consideration, I used 
Chatgpt to come up with the idea of diversity vs. popularity. Chatgpt helped point out how Spotify tends to recommend
artists and genres that listeners are already familiar with, instead of exposing them to other artists worldwide. Using AI
made it easier to narrow down our idea. https://chatgpt.com/share/68cf2bb0-a828-8002-951d-a7108e93dcbb 
    I also used Chatgpt to explain one concept that I needed to review before doing the exercises. I needed a quick example
how to use (s[start:end]). Sometimes its easier to visualize example code instead of having someone explain it conceptually.
